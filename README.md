## A bit about me..

Hey :wave:, I'm Paul a Software Writer based in Dorest. I enjoy mastering Vim, tinkering with my homelab using Kubernetes. Main language of choice is Python and SQL, while learning Go at the moment. Currently a Lead Solution Engineer in AdTech. I like to keep track of things I learn in my [TIL](https://github.com/mrpbennett/TIL) repo, I often find myself looking through this as a refresher.
