Currently a remote Lead Solutions Engineer at [Pulsepoint](https://pulsepoint.com) obsessed with Vim, Python, SQL and tinkering in the homelab.

I like to keep track of things I learn in my [TIL](https://github.com/mrpbennett/TIL) repo, I often find myself looking through this as a refresher.

### Languages that interest

1. Python
2. SQL
3. Kotlin
4. Ruby
5. Javscript

Currently attempting to learn Vim Motions and LazyVim to a component level.
