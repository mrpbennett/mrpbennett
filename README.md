More information can be found on my [personal website](https://mrpbennett.com) its [repo](https://github.com/mrpbennett/personal_site_2022) is also here. Also I like to keep track of things I learn in my [TIL](https://github.com/mrpbennett/TIL) repo, I often find myself looking through this as a refresher.
